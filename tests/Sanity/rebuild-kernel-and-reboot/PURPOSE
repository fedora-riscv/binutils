Using MACHINE_SET__STRONG host-filter for this test, by setting the "hardware"
section in TCMS properly. That has several effects:

  - kernel rebuild is very resoruce-intensive task, and having more powerful
    boxes for it is simply good,
  - this task will get its own boxes, not clobbered by additional kernel packages
    that are usually installed by other tasks in the same run. E.g.kernel-debuginfo,
    when installed, will conflict with freshly build kernel packages. This should
    workaround such situations,
  - this tasks reboots its boxes - should such reboot break something, don't ruin
    the whole run by it, right?
